# Revolve Game Balance Changes

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive balance changes made to the Revolve game to address exponential growth issues and create a more engaging, strategic gameplay experience.

## Major Balance Issues Fixed

### 1. Resource Production vs Consumption Mismatch
**Problem**: Infrastructure was producing far more resources than were being consumed, leading to resource overflow.

**Solution**:
- Reduced infrastructure base production values by 50-75%
- Increased resource consumption rates to be more realistic
- Added storage capacity limits for all resources

**Changes**:
- Food consumption: 0.5 → 1.0 per person
- Medicine consumption: 0.1 → 0.2 per person  
- Electricity consumption: 1.0 → 1.5 per person
- Happiness consumption: 0.05 → 0.1 per person
- Clothing consumption: 0.2 → 0.3 per person

### 2. Population Growth Explosion
**Problem**: Population was growing exponentially without limits, creating unsustainable scaling.

**Solution**:
- Implemented housing-based population capacity (10 people per housing level)
- Added maximum growth rate limit (10% per tick)
- Population growth now requires adequate resources
- Housing provides population capacity rather than unlimited growth

**New Mechanics**:
- Population growth = min(housing_capacity - current_population, max_growth_rate * current_population) * resource_factor
- Resource factor based on food, medicine, and electricity availability

### 3. Interest Rate Scaling
**Problem**: Interest rates could reach 20%, creating exponential money growth.

**Solution**:
- Reduced base interest rate from 1% to 0.5%
- Reduced scaling factor from 1% to 0.5%
- Capped maximum interest rate at 5% instead of 20%

### 4. Infrastructure Scaling
**Problem**: Infrastructure levels created exponential production increases.

**Solution**:
- Implemented efficiency decay with level increases (95% efficiency per level)
- Changed from exponential to linear level scaling
- Added diminishing returns for population assignment
- Population threshold now increases with infrastructure level

**New Formula**:
- Production = base_output × efficiency_decay^(level-1) × population_impact × (1 + (level-1) × 0.5)

### 5. Starting Conditions
**Problem**: Random starting conditions created unfair advantages.

**Solution**:
- Standardized starting population (50 instead of random 100-300)
- Standardized starting money (5000)
- All governments start with level 1 infrastructure
- Balanced starting resource amounts (50-200 instead of 1-1000)

## New Game Mechanics Added

### 1. Resource Storage Limits
Each resource now has a maximum storage capacity:
- Food: 1000 units
- Medicine: 500 units
- Electricity: 2000 units
- Happiness: 100 units
- Clothing: 800 units

### 2. Infrastructure Maintenance Costs
- All infrastructure now has ongoing maintenance costs
- Cost = base_cost × 1% × level per tick
- Prevents infinite infrastructure building

### 3. Sector-Based Money Generation
- Governments now generate money based on sector levels
- Money = (economy + health + safety + education) × 10 per tick
- Creates incentive to balance all sectors

### 4. Resource Efficiency Bonuses
Sector levels now provide bonuses to related resource production:
- Health sector improves food production
- Economy sector improves electricity and clothing production
- Education sector improves medicine production
- Safety sector improves happiness

### 5. Happiness Effects
- Low happiness (< 10) causes population decline and score penalties
- High happiness (> 80) provides bonuses
- Creates pressure to maintain citizen satisfaction

### 6. Crisis Events
- 5% chance per tick of a random crisis
- Crises affect specific sectors and resources
- Adds unpredictability and challenge

**Crisis Types**:
- Economic recession: Economy -2, Money -20%
- Health emergency: Health -2, Medicine -30%
- Safety incident: Safety -2, Happiness -20%
- Education crisis: Education -2

### 7. Policy System
New policy system allows strategic choices:
- Economic stimulus: Money +10%, Economy +0.5
- Healthcare reform: Medicine efficiency +20%, Health +0.5
- Education investment: Education +0.5, Research bonus
- Public safety: Safety +0.5, Happiness +10%
- Austerity: Money savings +20%, Overall -0.2

## Configuration Changes

### Game Settings
- Starting population: 10 → 50
- Increment rate: 0.1 → 0.05 (more gradual progression)
- Interest rate cap: 20% → 5%
- Seasonal impact multiplier: 1.0 → 0.5 (reduced seasonal effects)

### Infrastructure Costs
All infrastructure costs increased by 2x to make them more significant investments:
- Small Apartment: 1000 → 2000
- Large Apartment: 3000 → 6000
- Farm: 500 → 1000
- Food Processing: 2000 → 4000
- Power Station: 1500 → 3000
- Solar Farm: 4000 → 8000
- Hospital: 2500 → 5000
- Pharmaceutical: 5000 → 10000
- Clothing Factory: 2000 → 4000
- Textile Mill: 4500 → 9000

## Testing Tools

### Balance Test Command
```bash
php artisan game:balance-test --ticks=100 --interval=10
```
This command simulates 100 ticks and displays results every 10 ticks, checking for:
- Exponential growth warnings
- Resource overflow warnings
- Negative value errors

### Single Tick Command
```bash
php artisan game:tick --count=1
```
Processes a single tick with detailed balance information.

## Expected Gameplay Impact

### Early Game (Ticks 1-20)
- More challenging resource management
- Strategic decisions about which infrastructure to build first
- Population growth limited by housing and resources

### Mid Game (Ticks 21-80)
- Sector balance becomes crucial for efficiency bonuses
- Crisis events add unpredictability
- Policy decisions provide strategic depth

### Late Game (Ticks 81+)
- Diminishing returns prevent exponential scaling
- Maintenance costs create ongoing challenges
- Resource storage limits prevent infinite accumulation

## Monitoring and Adjustment

The game now includes comprehensive logging and monitoring:
- All balance changes are logged
- Crisis events are tracked
- Resource production and consumption are monitored
- Population growth is controlled and logged

Use the balance test command regularly to monitor game balance and adjust parameters as needed.
